Readline implementation in Rust that is based on [Antirez' Linenoise](https://github.com/antirez/linenoise)

**Supported Platforms**
* Unix (tested on FreeBSD, Linux and macOS)
* Windows
   * cmd.exe
   * Powershell

**Note**:
* Powershell ISE is not supported, check [issue #56](https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline/issues/56)
* Mintty (Cygwin/MinGW) is not supported
* Highlighting / Colors are not supported on Windows < Windows 10 except with ConEmu and `ColorMode::Forced`.

## Example
```rust
use rustyline::error::ReadlineError;
use rustyline::Editor;

fn main() {
    // `()` can be used when no completer is required
    let mut rl = Editor::<()>::new();
    if rl.load_history("history.txt").is_err() {
        println!("No previous history.");
    }
    loop {
        let readline = rl.readline(">> ");
        match readline {
            Ok(line) => {
                rl.add_history_entry(line.as_str());
                println!("Line: {}", line);
            },
            Err(ReadlineError::Interrupted) => {
                println!("CTRL-C");
                break
            },
            Err(ReadlineError::Eof) => {
                println!("CTRL-D");
                break
            },
            Err(err) => {
                println!("Error: {:?}", err);
                break
            }
        }
    }
    rl.save_history("history.txt").unwrap();
}
```

## Multi line support

This is a very simple feature that simply causes lines that are longer
than the current terminal width to be displayed on the next visual
line instead of horizontally scrolling as more characters are
typed. Currently this feature is always enabled and there is no
configuration option to disable it.

This feature does not allow the end user to hit a special key
sequence and enter a mode where hitting the return key will cause a
literal newline to be added to the input buffer.

The way to achieve multi-line editing is to implement the `Validator`
trait.
