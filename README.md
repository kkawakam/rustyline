## Build
This project uses Cargo and Rust stable
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Example
```rust
extern crate rustyline;

use rustyline::error::ReadlineError;
use rustyline::Editor;

fn main() {
    // `()` can be used when no completer is required
    let mut rl = Editor::<()>::new();
    if let Err(_) = rl.load_history("history.txt") {
        println!("No previous history.");
    }
    loop {
        let readline = rl.readline(">> ");
        match readline {
            Ok(line) => {
                rl.add_history_entry(&line);
                println!("Line: {}", line);
            },
            Err(ReadlineError::Interrupted) => {
                println!("CTRL-C");
                break
            },
            Err(ReadlineError::Eof) => {
                println!("CTRL-D");
                break
            },
            Err(err) => {
                println!("Error: {:?}", err);
                break
            }
        }
    }
    rl.save_history("history.txt").unwrap();
}

## ToDo

 - expose an API callable from C

## Wine

```sh
$ cargo run --example example --target 'x86_64-pc-windows-gnu'
...
Error: Io(Error { repr: Os { code: 6, message: "Invalid handle." } })
$ wineconsole --backend=curses target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/debug/examples/example.exe
...
```

## Terminal checks

```sh
$ # current settings of all terminal attributes:
$ stty -a
$ # key bindings:
$ bind -p
```
